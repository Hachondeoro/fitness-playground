Current solutions or fitness dedicated websites make it hard to get a solid grasp of what to do, hiding behind 20-30
pages of information, or overloading with technical knowledge the fitness enthusiast to make them spend days or months
trying to learn and understand what they have to do to lose weight or gain muscle.

Fitness Playground is a React application that aims to provide a simple and easy-to-understand solution to the fitness enthusiast by providing high quality tailored meal plans and gym workout routines that are easy to follow and understand.
